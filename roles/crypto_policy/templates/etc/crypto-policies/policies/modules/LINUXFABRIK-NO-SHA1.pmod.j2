# SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 160 bit
# hash value.

# The SHA-1 hash function has an inherently weak design, and advancing cryptanalysis
# has made it vulnerable to attacks. The most significant danger for a hash algorithm is
# when a "collision" which happens when two different pieces of data produce the same
# hash value occurs. This hashing algorithm has been considered weak since 2005.

# Note: The use of SHA-1 with hashbased message authentication codes (HMAC) do not
# rely on the collision resistance of the corresponding hash function, and therefore the
# recent attacks on SHA-1 have a significantly lower impact on the use of SHA-1 for
# HMAC. Because of this, the recommendation does not disable the hmac-sha1 MAC.
