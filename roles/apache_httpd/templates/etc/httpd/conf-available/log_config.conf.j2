# %b: Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers. In CLF format, i.e. a '-' rather than a 0 when no bytes are sent.
# %h: Remote hostname. Will log the IP address if HostnameLookups is set to Off, which is the default.
# %l: Remote logname (from identd, if supplied). This will return a dash unless mod_ident is present and IdentityCheck is set On.
# %O: Bytes sent, including headers. May be zero in rare cases such as when a request is aborted before a response is sent. You need to enable mod_logio to use this.
# %p: The canonical port of the server serving the request.
# %r: First line of request, in the format "GET / HTTP/1.1"
# %>s: Status, e.g. "304". For requests that have been internally redirected, this is the status of the original request. Use %>s for the final status.
# %t: Time the request was received, in the format [18/Sep/2011:19:18:28 -0400]. The last number indicates the timezone offset from GMT
# %u: Remote user if the request was authenticated. May be bogus if return status (%s) is 401 (unauthorized).
# %U: The URL path requested, not including any query string.
# %v: The canonical ServerName of the server serving the request.
